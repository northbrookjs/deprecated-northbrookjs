# Documentation

Many functions are not related specifically to Northbrook and can be used in
many other places. This library distributes ES6 source and defines `jsnext:main`
to allow for tree-shaking to remove any unused functions when combined with
a bundler like rollup or webpack 2.

All Functions are curried by default where it makes sense. If a functions marked
with a `*` next to it's name it is curried.
